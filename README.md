# Progressive 3D Skyscraper Visualization

This interactive visualization demonstrates the evolution of 3D graphics rendering techniques through five distinct phases, from simple wireframes to physically-based rendering.

## How to Interact with the Visualization

### Getting Started
1. Open the sketch in a web browser
2. Click the "Start Visualization" button on the intro screen
3. The cityscape will begin rendering, starting with the wireframe phase

### Navigation Between Rendering Phases
- Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons in the control panel to move between rendering phases
- Each phase represents a different era in 3D graphics history:
  - **Phase 1**: Vector Graphics (1960s-1970s)
  - **Phase 2**: Flat Shading with Texture (1970s-1980s)
  - **Phase 3**: Environmental Effects & Skybox (1990s)
  - **Phase 4**: Advanced Lighting & Materials (Mid-1990s to 2000s)
  - **Phase 5**: Physically Based Rendering (2010s to Present)

### Camera Controls
- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate the camera around the scene
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in and out
- Toggle the **Manual Camera** checkbox to switch between:
  - Manual control (you control the camera)
  - Automatic gentle camera movement
- Adjust **Camera Distance** slider to control how far away the camera is
- Adjust **Camera Height** slider to change the vertical position of the camera

### Environmental Controls
- **Rain Intensity**: Adjust the amount of rainfall in the scene (most visible in Phases 3-5)
- **Lighting Intensity**: Modify the brightness and mood of the scene

### Additional Features
- The control panel can be hidden by clicking the "âœ•" button
- To show the controls again, click the "Show Controls" button
- Descriptive information about each rendering phase is displayed at the top of the screen

## Technical Requirements
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Mouse recommended for best navigation experience
